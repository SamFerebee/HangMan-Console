# HangMan-Console
console version of the hangman game

I first coded this game in the beginning of June 2020, I started learning cpp and coding in April 2020.

This is v.1, I haven't cleaned up the code at all, I switched PlayerInfoClass member variables from private to public halfway through so there are getters and setters for public variables. This is pretty much just the first version that had the features I wanted and worked, it needs refactoring and plenty of other work still. I will continue to update this project as I continue on my journey of learning computer programming.
